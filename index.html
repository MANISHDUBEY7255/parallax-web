        <h2>Adventure Time !</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Adventure is the spice of life. It fills your life with freshness, enthusiasm and novel life experience! That’s why having an adventure is really important. The following short Paragraph on adventure speak about the adventure definition, importance and life adventure experiences, activities, adventure tips, sports etc. These Paragraphs are quite helpful for Children & Students of Primary, class 6,7,8th and high school level students.
          <br /><br />
          As the definition of adventure varies from person to person, it can be broadly defined as “taking a risk whose outcome is unknown”.

You’re challenged, you’re able to escape your ordinary lives so it changes you and makes you feel more alive & refreshed. You can seek adventure in many ways such as mountain climbing, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even exploring new people & cities can be considered an adventure.

Adventures are proven to be beneficial in many ways, including maintaining a positive self-image after completing a challenging task. Aside from expanding our horizons by exploring nature, cultures, and more, adventure can also help us gain insight into ourselves. We can unveil our hidden strengths in an unfamiliar situation when we let ourselves loose. It can force us to push our limits. <br/></br>

 Conclusion: It is an emotional experience that is meant to be catered to our soul to keep it alive. Adventure is the solution to boring chores.

          <h4>Theist</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            a person who believes in the existence of a god or gods, specifically of a creator who intervenes in the universe
            I am a hardcore theist and the person most close to me is my God my mom .
            <br></br>
            I am a Theist because this is the only thing that makes sense to me. I cannot intellectually perceive how the life in its current form can be sustained without the presence of a Super intelligent Supreme being and moreover what is the source and purpose of my existence.

            The default philosophy of this world is “Materialism”. In simple words, materialism means – “matter is all that matters”. Materialists seek more and more material things hoping that they will get more and more pleasure, and despite achieving more and more material possessions, there hunt for pleasure never ends. They are always on the pursuit of more and there is just no end to it.
            
           
          <br /><br />
          Materialism is a world view that is inherently self contradictory. At a broad level materialism means freedom, which means I can do whatever I want to do, I can enjoy whatever way I want and we contrast this with religion which has lot of restrictions. At a functional level, materialism may mean that I want more and more material things and I want to enjoy my life, but at a deeper existential level, materialism means that nothing exists beyond matter and my own existence is nothing but an interaction of material elements. Yet, what we have found (according to science) is that matter obeys certain laws and if we are simply creatures made of matter then we are pre-programmed machines. To explain this with an example, if I hold a stone at my shoulder height and release it, it will fall on the ground. The stone doesn’t have the free will to decide whether it will fall or not, it simply acts according to the laws of nature.

          <h4>Traveling</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Traveling is one of the most rewarding experiences a person could ever undertake. From visiting a variety of places, experiencing new cultures, and being able to explore foreign lands, traveling can present people with moments and experiences that can shape one’s life. Not everyone may feel comfortable taking a trip to a new land, but the benefits of traveling can outweigh any uneasiness or reservations.
          <br /><br />
          There are many tangible benefits to traveling. People can experience new sights, sounds, and sensations from their travels that give them a wider perspective. For those on a spiritual journey, many find it calming and even therapeutic to explore new destinations. Travelers often observe members of different societies, expanding their understanding of life’s vast diversity. In the modern world, travelers are better equipped than ever to learn about different cultures and visit places that were previously inaccessible.

          Traveling can provide us with insight into other cultures. We can learn about the history, language, and cultures of the people we come into contact with while traveling. Traveling also helps us to gain global understanding, allowing us to become respected citizens of the world. We can share stories and experiences with people from other places, broadening our worldview and outlook.
          <br /><br />
          Ultimately, the rewards of traveling are infinite. People can find themselves being challenged, enriched, and inspired by their travels, making them some of the most rewarding experiences one can have. Whether you are looking to explore a place or learn more about the world around you, embarking on a journey can provide you with immense knowledge, understanding, and personal growth.

          <h4>Chhath puja</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Chhath puja is one of the most important festivals of UP and Bihar which lies in the North-East part of India. It is celebrated in the Shukla paksha, 6th of Kartika (a Hindu month). It is an auspicious occasion and is celebrated every year. In this puja, people keep fast for 3 days. It can be done by either male or female. Who so ever wants to fulfill their wish they pray to Chhati Mata.
            People keep this fast and fulfill their wishes and nowadays people across the world can be seen celebrating this festival. People have a lot of beliefs for this special occasion and there are many rules and restrictions that should be followed while performing this fast.

          <br /><br />
          I love this festival very much because every year we visit our native place where my grandparents live, my cousins also visit them to take part in this occasion. My grandmother, aunt, and my mother every year keep fast for 3 days and it does not look as if they are hungry.

They sing traditional devotional songs, make maha prasad and we also help them, by arranging mango wood sticks for preparing the maha prasad. The maha prasad is cooked separately on a handmade stove. We enjoy three days, we are actually free these days to do anything, I play with my cousins and we visit Ghats to offer prayer with other ladies. Really it is an amazing experience and I wait for this festival every year.
<br><br/>
Chhath Puja is not a festival it is emotion for us......
